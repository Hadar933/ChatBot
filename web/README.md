# Simple example for Chat

For now - just copied some old chat from old Youtube course for React that can be great template to start with.

## How to run
1. Make sure Node.js and Npm are installed in your machine.
2. Go to `./web` directory'
3. run `npm install` to install all project dependencies.
4. run `npm run start` to run project.

It should open the browser automatically. if not, go to http://localhost:3000

### Extra
The chat is working for few people.<br>
you can open few windows to chat together.
